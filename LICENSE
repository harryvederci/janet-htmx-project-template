Well, this isn't really a license yet. In the future this document will contain
only the MIT license.

Until the Circlet server dependency is replaced with something else, this
codebase should be considered to have the dual GPLv2 / commercial license
mentioned here:
  https://github.com/janet-lang/circlet/blob/master/LICENSE


After replacing Circlet, I will relicense this codebase to the MIT license.
For contributors: you have my blessing to use anything in the ./src/ directory
of this codebase as if it already has the MIT license.
Contributions are welcome from authors who are OK with the above.
All contributions *will* be relicensed to the MIT license.

Note that the relicense to the MIT license should be OK, as the licenses of the
other used libraries are as follows:
 - cipher:     MIT
 - janet-html: MIT
 - json:       MIT
 - path:       MIT
 - sqlite:     MIT (= the Janet library. SQLite itself is in the public domain)
 - suresql:    MIT
 - testament:  MIT
 - tw:         MIT



echo "OMG what's wrong with the GPL?" > /dev/null

Janet is a relatively young programming language with a seemingly strong
consensus for using the MIT license in libraries. The fact that I've been able
to grab all-but-1 library for this codebase without having to think twice (/
write this dissertation) has been great, and I think at this point in time it
would be bad for the Janet community if we start "complecting" programming with
legal work.

I'm very grateful for the work of Richard Stallman and the Free Software
Foundation, though. Consider donating to the FSF!
